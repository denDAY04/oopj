/**
 * Test constructed in order to simulate searching through a list of threads
 * named with IP addresses, the list being at most 1,000 elements long.
 * This was used to determine whether it would be viable to keep track of active
 * handler threads, the <code>UDPPacketHandler</code> instances. It is a legacy
 * test, since its results were negative and the design was later changed to
 * communication be direct between client and handler thread, eliminating the
 * need for keeping track of active handlers.
