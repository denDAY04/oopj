The server as a .jar file (se the dist folder) including the lib folder within the dist folder
  is uploated to the "root" aka home folder on the web/RMI server ... 
Since this folder is unavaliable to the outside world, and since the RMI skeletons needs to be
remote accessible to outside clients, the jar file is also copied to the public_html folder

the . ExecuteServer script that (when given execute status under nix) is responsible for executing the server, and 
should be in the "root"/home folder and NOT the public_html
